# Xperi Splunk Resources
This repo is for resources made available by Xperi, Inc. related to Splunk.

This repo will attempt to be organized in a fashion that makes it easy
to find the resources that we're publishing.

If the resource was part of a .conf talk, then it will be in a structure like:
```
conf/<year>/<Session ID>
```

Other structures will be defined as they come up.
